# Introduction

* background on oyster importance in ecosystem/ environment
* oyster pop ~10% of 1980's levels
    * background on possible causes (over harvesting/ ocean acidification/ Gulf of Maine one of fastest warming regions/ other physiochemical variables)
* Resteration projects are trying to fix issues
    * larval reproduction and settlement important for building populations

* Is there a difference in sites for oyster reproduction
    * larval abundance
        * if there is a difference, why? (physiochemical data collected possible reasons?)

# Methods

* kable(s) of average occurance of D/V larvae between years at each site
* ANOVA across years for D/V larvae/ maybe for bewteen sites within each year
* mean/SD of temp/salinity/pH across years in plot
* physiochemical vs larvae rates analysis
* plot lat/ long on top of a map of area
    * **(this is a maybe, would be a cool graphic, will try if I get to learning how to upload a map to R and add the datapoints)**
