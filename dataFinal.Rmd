# Introduction

Oysters are an important member of their ecosystems, but their population has been in major decline. Oyster reefs are sites that provide habitats for many organisms, where important nutrient cycles are managed, and many more beneficial processes occur [@beck_oyster_2011]. Sadly, a catastrophic decline in New Hampshire oyster population has been recorded, with only 10% of the population being what it was in the 1980's. Decline has been attributed to major diseases, human harvest and anthropogenic impacts, decline in oyster shell substrate for larval settling, and low recruitment [@grizzle_assessment_2016]. 
  
There have been restorative efforts in the local Great Bay Estuary (GBE) of New Hampshire. Oyster spat has been distributed in restoration sites in the GBE, with different sites having varying degrees of success [@grizzle_assessment_2016]. Restorative success depends on recruitment in wild populations of oysters, which can depend on many factors. One factor could be ocean acidification. The ocean absorbs CO~2~ from the air. When air CO~2~ concentrations increase, it causes the pH of the ocean to go down into a more acidic environment called ocean acidification which can affect shell growth in early larval stages. Other factors include salinity and temperature.

By finding where oyster larvae are most abundant throughout the GBE, this study aims to find the best environmental conditions for oyster reproduction. This data will aid future restoration efforts by showing what factors to focus on for optimal restoration results.

# Methods

All data was collected at the Great Bay Estuary in New Hampshire. Six sites in total were used in the study. Woodman’s Point (WP), Nannie Island (NI), the Lamprey River (LR), and Squamscott River (SR) were collected in the 2018 and 2019 seasons. In the 2020 season WP and NI were used again, while Adams Point (AP) and an oyster farm (OF) were added. Collection of samples from the GBE and counting of D-hinge and Veliger larvae was completed by @stasse_temporal_2022. Physiochemical data was collected by the Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) data buoy for each sampling day. 

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was performed to test for differences of D-hinge and veliger counts among years. A Tukey's honnestly significant difference (HSD) was performed *post-hoc* among sampling years for D-hinge annd veliger counts. Regression models were performed for pH, temperature, and salinity as independent variables, and D-hinge and veliger counts as dependent variables using log(count) adjusted data to meet normalcy standards. Stats were all performed using @base_R version 4.2.2.

# Results

In 2018, mean abundance was `r sumLarvalType[1,3]` (SE = `r sumLarvalType[1,6]`) D-hinge larvae m^-3^, and `r sumLarvalType[2,3]` (SE = `r sumLarvalType[2,6]`) veliger larvae m^-3^. In 2019, mean abundance was `r sumLarvalType[3,3]` (SE = `r sumLarvalType[3,6]`) D-hinge larvae m^-3^, and `r sumLarvalType[4,3]` (SE = `r sumLarvalType[4,6]`) veliger larvae m^-3^. In 2020, mean abundance was `r sumLarvalType[5,3]` (SE = `r sumLarvalType[5,6]`) D-hinge larvae m^-3^, and `r sumLarvalType[6,3]` (SE = `r sumLarvalType[6,6]`, Fig. \ref{fig:site}) veliger larvae m^-3^. Analysis of variance showed `r ifelse(cleanBothAOV[1,6]<=0.05, 'significant', 'insignificant')` differences in the count of both D-hinge and veliger larvae between years (F = `r cleanBothAOV[1,5]`, p `r ifelse(cleanBothAOV[1,6]<0.001, '< 0.001', paste("= ", cleanBothAOV[1,6], sep = ""))`, Fig. \ref{fig:boxplot}). It was found that temperature was positively associated with D-hinge larval counts (p `r ifelse(coef(dTTemp[4])[2,4]<0.001, '< 0.001', paste("= ", format(coef(dTTemp[4])[2,4], digits = 2), sep = ""))`, adj. R^2^ = `r format(dTTemp[9], digits = 2)`, Fig. \ref{fig:regressions}~A~). It was found that salinity was negatively associated (p `r ifelse(coef(dTSal[4])[2,4]<0.001, '< 0.001', paste("= ", format(coef(dTSal[4])[2,4], digits = 2), sep = ""))`, adj. R^2^ = `r format(dTSal[9], digits = 2)`, Fig. \ref{fig:regressions}~B~) with D-hinge larval counts. It was found that temperature was positively associated (p `r ifelse(coef(vTTemp[4])[2,4]<0.001, '< 0.001', paste("= ", format(coef(vTTemp[4])[2,4], digits = 2), sep = ""))`, adj. R^2^ = `r format(vTTemp[9], digits = 2)`, Fig. \ref{fig:regressions}~C~) with veliger larval counts.
 
# Discussion

The purpose of studying this data was to find factors that could effect oyster larval levels within the GBE.

The data showed that there was not a significant difference in larval count between the different locations collected from. The earliest that larvae were observed in the GBE was in the middle of June, then continued to peak around the middle of July. Observations slowed down through August, and mostly stopped at the beginning of September. There was a significant difference in the amount of larvae found between years, but the most significant difference is comparing this data from 2018-2020 to data from 2013-2015 from @eckert_oyster_2016. Just these couple of years since that study, there has been a huge decrease in larval rates in the GBE.

Out of the physiochemical factors that were recorded and analyzed, only temperature was positively correlated both with D-hinge and veliger larval levels, with salinity having a negative correlation with only D-hinge larvae counts. These results are similar to those in @narvaez_modeling_2012 where higher temperatures and lower salinity resulted in larger observed larvae. 

Knowing that we can find factors that are correlated with larval rates in the GBE, future studies should focus on finding factors that could better predict where restoration efforts would have better or worse effect. Biotic factors such as phytoplankton blooms have been shown to effect other marine organisms, so it would not be surprising if this was found to be the case with oysters as well. Studying more factors would make sure that efforts can be utilized in a more optimal way.
