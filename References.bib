	abstract = {Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica populations have been declining steadily over the past several decades across the North American East coast. The Great Bay Estuary (GBE), located in New Hampshire, is experiencing this loss and restoration efforts have been put into effect. This paper characterizes larval abundances of settled spat and two early stages of C. virginica, D-hinge and veliger, in GBE from 2018 to 2020. Abundances are compared based on date of sampling, year, collection site, and the physicochemical data recorded on each sampling date. It was found that overall, D-hinge larval abundances have declined signi cantly from 2018 to 2020, whereas veliger abundances have remained steady or increased. Although the physicochemical factors are known to play a role in larval abundance, very little signi cance was found, suggesting future study may need to be modi ed to include a broader range of factors (e.g., more temporal sampling). This study indicates that both D-Hinge, veliger, and spat settlement occur in GBE before when sampling traditionally has started (June), suggesting an earlier than previously thought rst spawn of C. virginica in GBE. This nding can be used to enhance restoration efforts as it suggests that spat brought in to augment current sites of active restoration should be released earlier in the season and that recruitment devices should be deployed before the previously thought rst spawn of each season.},

	abstract = {The interactions of circulation and growth processes in determining the horizontal distribution of eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) larvae in the Delaware Bay estuary were investigated with a coupled circulation-individual-based larvae model that used environmental conditions from the spawning seasons (mid-June to mid-September) of 1984, 1985, 1986, 2000, and 2001. Particles, representing oyster larvae, were released at ﬁve-day intervals from areas in Delaware Bay that correspond to natural oyster reefs. The simulated larval development time was used to estimate potential larval success, determined by the percent of larvae that successfully reached settlement size (330 μm) within the planktonic larval duration of 30 days. Success rates for simulated larvae released in the upper estuary were less than half of those released in the lower estuary because of the reduction in growth rate from exposure to low salinity. Simulated larval success rates were further reduced during periods of increased river discharge, which produced low salinity conditions. The simulated transport patterns showed a down-estuary drift of oyster larvae during the spawning season, which is consistent with the observed reduction in settlement and recruitment rates in the upper estuary. The simulated transport pathways patterns showed that larvae originating in the middle and lower regions of the estuary had low rates of dispersion and high rates of self-settlement. Larvae released in the upper reaches of the estuary had limited contributions to the Delaware Bay oyster population, in part because of the lower overall simulated larval success in the low salinity regions. The simulated transport patterns suggested that the upper bay exports rather than receives larvae, which has implications for the establishment of genetic traits.},

	abstract = {Oyster populations in New Hampshire’s Great Bay Estuary have experienced dramatic declines similar to populations along the east coast. These declines have caused ecosystem degradation in estuaries and prompted a focus on oyster reef restoration. Despite the large use of procured funds dedicated for oyster reef restoration, few quantifiable successes have occurred. Currently, there is no rigorous method for determining where a restored reef would have the highest probability for long-term success. However, consistent and substantial natural recruitment is a major factor to consider.
In this research, I identify historic trends in oyster populations, quantify the success and failures of restored reefs, and examine how proximity to a native oyster reef affects recruitment. Oyster populations throughout the Great Bay Estuary declined significantly after the introduction of two diseases, MSX and Dermo, in 1995. Although, populations rebounded after large spatfall events, three to four years after these events population levels declined, probably mainly a result of disease.
My results suggest oyster recruitment is significantly greater on natural oyster reefs compared to restored reefs. There was also a significant increase in recruitment on restoration reefs less than 1 km from a native reef compared to restoration reefs greater than 1 km from a native reef. Furthermore, recruitment decreased significantly as proximity from a native reef increased. Results suggest that restoration efforts should consider extending the natural boundary of native oyster reefs to provide the greatest potential for natural recruitment and thus long-term reef development.},

	abstract = {Native oyster reefs once dominated many estuaries, ecologically and economically. Centuries of resource extraction exacerbated by coastal degradation have pushed oyster reefs to the brink of functional extinction worldwide. We examined the condition of oyster reefs across 144 bays and 44 ecoregions; our comparisons of past with present abundances indicate that more than 90\% of them have been lost in bays (70\%) and ecoregions (63\%). In many bays, more than 99\% of oyster reefs have been lost and are functionally extinct. Overall, we estimate that 85\% of oyster reefs have been lost globally. Most of the world's remaining wild capture of native oysters (\&gt; 75\%) comes from just five ecoregions in North America, yet the condition of reefs in these ecoregions is poor at best, except in the Gulf of Mexico. We identify many cost-effective solutions for conservation, restoration, and the management of fisheries and nonnative species that could reverse these oyster losses and restore reef ecosystem services.},
