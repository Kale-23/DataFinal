This study found that rats process information about their environment differently in different situations, even in the same environment. The rats processed right vs left repetition trials in mostly different cells within the hippcampus. I wonder if long term storage of these memories would be closer than in two different situations in different environments. Is the neocortical storage space layed out by location, or other factors?


I would think that environmental location would have something to do with storage location of memories. Different locations would have very different grid, border cell, space cell etc. firing patterns within a memory, while memories in the same location would have very similar firing patterns. I guess a follow up question I would need answered first is if further away imputs (such as olfactory vs visual) would result in hippocampal processing that results in different output locations. This could mean that similar situations are stored close to each other, which through personal experience, I get confused sometimes (ex. which time did I get the burger from my favorite restaurant?) and further apart memories would be less likely to be confused (I never mix up when I walk through my house vs college woods).


Neural Activity in Human Hippocampal Formation Reveals the Spatial Context of Retrieved Memories


So when someone remembers an item, the context such as the spatial location and relative information are also recalled. This could get confusing if the item has to be constantly recalled, reliving a very close episodic memory to the original every time. What seperates these very close memories from enother enough that you can recognize each as its own memory?


I dont actually think we are able to store each instance of a very similar memory. I am not sure if this is why we feel deja vu, or where we have done something but dont remember it. We also blend very similar memories together, such as anual events and not being able to remember each individual thing that happens between years (something like memory blending?). The paper does mention a recent discovery of rat neurons encoding relative times of events, but this opens new questions on what kind of time these encode (daily cycle or up to what year something took place in).

Does this neural representation of location form part of the spatiotemporal context into which episodic memories are encoded? We recorded medial temporal lobe neuronal activity as epilepsy patients performed a hybrid spatial and episodic memory task. We identified place-responsive cells active during virtual navigation and then asked whether the same cells activated during the subsequent recall of navigation-related memories without actual navigation. Place-responsive cell activity was reinstated during episodic memory retrieval. Neuronal firing during the retrieval of each memory was similar to the activity that represented the locations in the environment where the memory was initially encoded.},

	abstract = {Theories on the functions of the hippocampal system are based largely on two fundamental discoveries: the amnestic consequences of removing the hippocampus and associated structures in the famous patient H.M. and the observation that spiking activity of hippocampal neurons is associated with the spatial position of the rat. In the footsteps of these discoveries, many attempts were made to reconcile these seemingly disparate functions. Here we propose that mechanisms of memory and planning have evolved from mechanisms of navigation in the physical world and hypothesize that the neuronal algorithms underlying navigation in real and mental space are fundamentally the same. We review experimental data in support of this hypothesis and discuss how specific firing patterns and oscillatory dynamics in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus can support both navigation and memory.},

How are we able to keep our memories in order, if they are stored within theta wave time intervals? When we have a long term memory, it is usually stored in the order that the memory occurred in or a shortened version, but all pieces still in order. How is the brain able to store these memories so they can be recalled in order, as well as how is it able to form the “compressed sequence” when a full episodic memory is not needed?


I think the explanation that made some sense to me was ““This multiple-timescale mechanism may explain why each snippet of a recalled episode is experienced as if it was occurring in real time, because the temporal dynamic during recall is supported by the same mechanism as during the encoding process.” This means that the same time keeping mechanism that encodes the original memory also runs during remembering. Would this process be the one that is in charge of procedural generation of the memory during remembering? I would think it works as the hippocampus recognizes a memory, it pulls up the place in the memory that is being remembered, and then procedurally pulls up each long term memory that is stored in the neocortex, which may or may not be the whole memory, just the important parts that were important enough to be stored long term. Maybe this occurs in a linked list way, where remembering a memory, the memory links to the next segment of the memory, as well as links to the memory before it in time.

In contrast, there has been controversy over whether the hippocampus mediates a similarly general memory function in other species, or whether it is dedicated to spatial memory processing3,4,5,6. Evidence for the spatial view is derived principally from the observations of ‘place cells’—hippocampal neurons that fire whenever the animal is in a particular location in its environment7,8, or when it perceives a specific stimulus or performs a specific behaviour in a particular place3,4. We trained rats to perform the same recognition memory task in several distinct locations in a rich spatial environment and found that the activity of many hippocampal neurons was related consistently to perceptual, behavioural or cognitive events, regardless of the location where these events occurred. These results indicate that non-spatial events are fundamental elements of hippocampal representation, and support the view that, across species, the hippocampus has a broad role in information processing associated with memory.},

The hippocampus probably only initiates learning of memories. Once the memory has been remembered and encoded enough times, it is able to be recalled without the hippocampi’s help as its connections in the brain are strong enough. We know that the hippocampus does not store memories both from previous papers (where we learned that positional information at least is stored in the neocortex), as well as the fact that the patients did not lose all of their memories when their hippocampi were disconnected from inputs.
The question above leads me to the next question of, if the hippocampus is not the only pathway for inputs to get to memory, what is/are the other pathway/s and how do the pathways differ? 
I would expect the hippocampal pathway of inputs would be exclusively for creating and maintaining memories, while any other pathway would be for different reasons such as recall of memories. Maybe strong enough memories with strong connections (older + more important) when remembered attempt to avoid using the hippocampus, as creating new pathways and reinforcing them would be power intensive compared to just searching for and retrieving a memory? This type of pathway could survive hippocampal disconection, while still being able to at least recall old memories.
